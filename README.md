# ExpertSystem
Opensource Expert System  with Fuzzy Logic to control industrial process using Python Notebook. [(see it here)]
(http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thimotio/ExpertSystem/blob/master/Froth_Flotation_Fuzzy_Control_v01.ipynb)

# Motivation
Did you know that you could develop advanced industrial process control systems without having to resort to proprietary software?
Do you believe that technology is no longer a barrier and that process knowledge determines the success of this type of application?


# Objective
Develop a simple expert system with fuzzy logic control to a generic Iron Ore Froth Flotation process and test.
The Fuzzy control should acts on reagents and froth level to obtain quality goals and cost reduction.


# Further details
 - Programming Language for data analysis: **Python**
 - Fuzzy control: **scikit-fuzzy**
 - Data handling tools: **pandas** helping with data-frame operations
 - Data Visualization tools: **Mathplotlib**
 
# Disclaimer

This code was created for the educational purpose and sharing of advanced control techniques.

For application in real cases of process in the industry it is necessary to model the controls as well as to identify the limits and interrelations of the variables to guarantee operational safety.
