Exploratory Analyses of Industrial Labor Accidents using Python Notebook [(see it here)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ihmstefanini/industrial-accident-analyses/blob/master/IHMStefanini_Exploratory_Analyses_Industrial_Labor_Accidents.ipynb)


# Motivation
Did you know that you could develop advanced industrial process control systems without having to resort to proprietary software?
Do you believe that technology is no longer a barrier and that process knowledge determines the success of this type of application?


# Objective
Develop a simple expert system with fuzzy logic control to a generic Iron Ore Froth Flotation process and test with a CSV data file.
The Fuzzy control should acts on reagents and froth level to obtain quality goals and cost reduction.


# Further details
 - Programming Language for data analysis: **Python**
 - Data handling tools: **pandas** helping with data-frame operations
 - Data Visualization tools: **Mathplotlib**
